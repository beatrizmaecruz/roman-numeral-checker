# US Telephone Number Checker

This was a little project I made for the freeCodeCamp cirriculum in the JavaScript course.
This was made completely from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This utilizes regex to check if an input is a valid US phone number.

Examples of valid US phone number formats are:
1 555-555-5555
1 (555) 555-5555
1(555)555-5555
1 555 555 5555
5555555555
555-555-5555
(555)555-5555
