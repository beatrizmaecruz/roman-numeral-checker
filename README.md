# US Telephone Number Checker

This was a little project I made for the freeCodeCamp cirriculum in the JavaScript course.
This was made completely from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This utilizes regex to check if an input is a valid US phone number.

Examples of valid US phone number formats are:<br>
1 555-555-5555 <br>
1 (555) 555-5555 <br>
1(555)555-5555 <br>
1 555 555 5555 <br>
5555555555 <br>
555-555-5555 <br>
(555)555-5555
